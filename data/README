caves.tif is an image created from CSV data supplied by 
//pdsimage2.wr.usgs.gov/Individual_Investigations/mars_mro.odyssey_multi_cavecatalog_cushing_2016/data/


hydrated_final.png is a handmade rendition of the data in the image at
//sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/51857-mars-hydrated-mineral-map


Both images are 3600x1800 Mercator projections, so each pixel is 0.1 
degrees in both dimensions. At the equator, this makes each pixel about 
6 km square.
